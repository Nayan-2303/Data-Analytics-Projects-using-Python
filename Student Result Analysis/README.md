## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Place the dataset `Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv` in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Data Analysis Steps
1. **Load and Preview Data**: Load the dataset and preview the first few rows to understand its structure.
2. **Data Summary and Information**: Generate a summary and get information about the dataset, including data types and non-null counts.
3. **Gender Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of genders in the dataset.
4. **Impact of Parent's Education on Student Scores**: Analyze the impact of parent's education on student scores using a heatmap.
5. **Impact of Parent's Marital Status on Student Scores**: Analyze the impact of parent's marital status on student scores using a heatmap.
6. **Distribution of Scores**: Visualize the distribution of math, reading, and writing scores using boxen plots.
7. **Distribution of Ethnic Groups**: Visualize the distribution of different ethnic groups using a pie chart and count plot.

## Results
- **Gender Distribution**: The number of females in the dataset is more than the number of males.
- **Parent's Education Impact**: The education level of parents has a positive impact on student scores.
- **Parent's Marital Status Impact**: There is negligible impact on student scores due to their parent's marital status.
- **Ethnic Group Distribution**: Visualizations show the distribution of different ethnic groups within the dataset.
